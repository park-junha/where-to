## Where To?

Where To is a web broswer extension that replaces your New Tab with a customizable, personalized interface.

Where To is currently in alpha. You can download it from the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/where-to/kdhcodpjaffhbbphkahnkbllddjihima)!

## Development Server

To run a development server, navigate to `ui` and run the following:

```
yarn add
yarn start
```

## Install Locally

### Google Chrome

1. Navigate to `ui` and run `yarn build`. This will produce a `build` folder within the `ui` directory.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome and enable Developer mode (located on top right).
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `build` directory generated by step 1.
4. To update your extension with a future version, come back to `chrome://extensions` and click the circular arrow on your extension's card or "Update" near the top left (updates all extensions).

### Firefox

1. Navigate to `ui` and run `yarn build`. This will produce a `build` folder within the `ui` directory.
2. Go to `about:debugging` in Firefox, navigate to **This Firefox**, and click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select any file in `ui/build/`. The New Tab interface should now be loaded with Where To.
